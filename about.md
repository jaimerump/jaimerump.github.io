# Hello World

I'm Jaime Rump, a web developer from Northern Kentucky. When I'm not writing code, I'm usually eating, sleeping, or driving. But sometimes I play games!

I tutored for programming classes at Northern Kentucky University for 2 years, then I went into web development. I started out with PHP and Zend Framework, then I played with Python and Django, and now I'm working in Ruby on Rails. I've also done some Android development, and now I'm working on picking up iOS. You can follow my work at [CompleteSet](https://www.completeset.com) or see my [Github.](https://github.com/jaimerump)
