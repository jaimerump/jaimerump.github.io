# Professional

I'm Jaime Rump, a (mostly backend) full-stack web developer from Northern Kentucky.

I tutored for programming classes at Northern Kentucky University for 2 years, then cofounded [CompleteSet](https://www.completeset.com). I built an alpha version of the website in 2012 in PHP, MySQL, and Backbone.js. Then in 2014 I built a beta version using Rails and Angular.js, along with a mobile API. In 2016 I helped rebuild it with Go microservices, a React/Redux frontend, and a Node.js event processor.

For more, see all of my abandoned projects on my [Github.](https://github.com/jaimerump)

# Personal
I'm into D&D and kitchen table Magic, because I'm a nerd, I have to be. I have a small collection of action figures, a large collection of abandoned hobbies, and a larger collection of FunKo pops. I love reading science fiction and fantasy, especially Brandon Sanderson, and I edit for my novelist friend Cody Schaber.
